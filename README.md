# JS-Protractor UI framework

The project contains the sources for UI automation framework based on Cucumber, JS and Protractor with 'chai' and 'chai-as-promised' assertion libraries.
For functional test scenarios I use Cucumber JavaScript implementation in order to combine it with Protractor API.
Cucumber also allows to organize suites of tests together with tags and hooks.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run 'protractor protractor.conf.js' in your IDE terminal.
